# (incomplete) 2 players game "Middle Ages"
The logic had been writen in pure C, UI - in Qt. The binding script between UI and logic is incomplete, but game is playable.
It's a turn based strategy game on square grid board with 3 pawn's types: King, Knight and Peasant. Goal - kill a king of opposite player. Main rule this game is peasant special ability: if 3 turns peasant does nothing, then he can clone yourself on any tile near him and new peasant play this turn.
